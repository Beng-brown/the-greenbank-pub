## Welcome to the Greenbank Pub!

This project was created for my first milestone project with code institutes Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development. I have chosen to create this fiction website since I actually personally work at this pub and thought it would be a good base for my first project- as well as lending to ample indivisuals to test and gain feedback from.

# User Experience

## Purpose

This website is for the Greenbank Pub- I have set out to create an easily navigated website built with the purpose of advertising to new potential customers and offering more information on people wanting to visit and book into the establishment. 
 
 This website is aimed at a large general audiance to offer easily obtained information on our opening times, food and drinks offerings etc. As well as giving the option to contact us in regards to bookings or other enquires. With the aim of making the requesting more informationa and booking process and quick and painless as possible. 

 The plan was to make the site as easily navigatable and understandable for people of all ages and walks of life. The design of the site reflects this with keeping it simple yet visually attractive.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

I created a pallete using the site 	[Coolers ](https://coolors.co/). I choose to go with a Green theme for obvious reasons. Creating a nice earthy, soothing colors which also offered great contrast. Ideal for highlighting headers, defining sections and other important infomation.

## Fonts

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my webpage fonts. I settled with 'Inter' I really liked this font it was nice and readable for accesability reasons. It also came with a range of weights, which ment after some playing around I only needed the one font. With the added weight it gave great contrast between headers and areas of text. I feel it complimented site really well. I also used the back up as san-serif.

## Wireframes and Structure

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create some previews of what I envisioned my site to look like. This was a great tool, as even though my finished project does stray slightly to the orginal plan, fimga allowed me to already have my fonts, color schemes and general layout of the site ready to code. This being my first project benifited my enormiously.

As you can see, during the coding process I created another page and moved the food & drink section over. I chose to do this as  felt the page was slightly conjested and it made room for a small gallery on the index page.

The sites structure comprises of 

- A Home page
- Food & Drinks page
- Booking Page

### Features

**ALL** the pages contain the same header and footer. And follow the same pattern of having a hero image placed just below. 

**Header**- The header comprises of two parts 1) being the logo which I created myself using figma and then exporting it. 2) Being the navigation links on the opposite side. Giving a smiple but smart apperance. 

As shown below in desktop and then mobile sized screens. On smaller screens the navigation links shift to beneith the logo. Allowing for greater asetics, user experence and showing repsonsive design.

<br>

**Footer**- The footer also follows a similar template however instead of a logo there is the address and the contact details of the venue. Followed on the otherside by social media links. 

Similarly to the header this also folds when on smaller screensizes. For the same reasons as above.

### Home Page

The home page comprises of 3 sections the first being a hero image followed by an "about" paragraph giving a breif background on the pub. We then have a gallery consisting of 6 images & finally followed by a section about our customer loyalty scheme inc a sign up form and our pub/kicthen opening times.

All pictures and text have been carefully placed and picked so that it is obvious that this page is for a pub/restaraunt.
