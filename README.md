## Welcome to the Greenbank Pub!

This project was created for my first milestone project with code institutes Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development. I have chosen to create this fiction website since I actually personally work at this pub and thought it would be a good base for my first project- as well as lending to ample indivisuals to test and gain feedback from.

# User Experience

## Purpose

This website is for the Greenbank Pub- I have set out to create an easily navigated website built with the purpose of advertising to new potential customers and offering more information on people wanting to visit and book into the establishment. 
 
 This website is aimed at a large general audiance to offer easily obtained information on our opening times, food and drinks offerings etc. As well as giving the option to contact us in regards to bookings or other enquires. With the aim of making the requesting more informationa and booking process and quick and painless as possible. 

 The plan was to make the site as easily navigatable and understandable for people of all ages and walks of life. The design of the site reflects this with keeping it simple yet visually attractive.
